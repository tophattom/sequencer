# Sequencer

This is a (currently) simple sequencer build with HTML, JavaScript and CSS

## Running

Just open index.html. Angular and other dependencies are fetched from CDNs,
so internet connection is required.

## Browser compatibility

Works on all browsers that support Web Audio API (all but IE). CSS still needs prefixing for the layout to work correctly in Safari.
