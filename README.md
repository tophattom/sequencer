# Sequencer

This is a (currently) simple sequencer build with HTML, JavaScript and CSS

## Running

Just open index.html. Angular and other dependencies are fetched from CDNs,
so internet connection is required.

## Browser compatibility

Works best on Chrome, Firefox works too expect for some layout quirks.
Doesn't work on Safari. IE not tested.
